//This is about the data types


/* This is about the numbers 

Integers: (negative, zero and positive)
Float-point numbers : Decimal number for example:- -3.5, 0.01, 

*/


/*This is all about the strings

It is a collection of characters 

'a', 'Ram', 'Sama ammamam' or "This is ram "
these all are the string types 

*/

/*This is all about the boolean

This is for the only true or false nothing much
either true or false

*/

/* if varaiable is declered but the value is not assiged then it will return undefined 
 for example
 let fristName;
 console.log(firstName); it will return undefined as the value is not assigned in the varibale
*/

// Null in js refers to empty value. We can assign null for variable. 


/*
These are the some of the examples of how we can declare the variable but the best practice is
camelCase but we can define it in different ways

firstName
lastName
country
city
capitalCity
age
isMarried

first_name
last_name
is_married
capital_city

num1
num_1
_num_1
$num1
year2020
year_2020

*/

/*
THese are some examples of invalid ways to decalre variables

  first-name
  1_num
  num_#_1

*/

/*
Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, 
however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble
let name = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland'
console.log(name, job, live)
